/**
 * Spring-based client for querying the web service endpoints.
 * <p>
 * It supports the only operation which the
 * {@link com.bernardomg.example.swss.endpoint.ExampleEntityEndpoint
 * ExampleEntityEndpoint} has: querying an entity by its id.
 * <p>
 * As with that same endpoint, this client by default is unsecured. Any such
 * concern is to be taken care by Spring. This means that by default it will
 * only be able to query unsecure endpoints.
 * <p>
 * There is a problem with some security protocols, such as encryption, which
 * may make the endpoints unreachable. To solve this a
 * {@link SoapActionCallback} will be used by the client when querying, this
 * will add a SOAP action header to the request, which won't disappear even if
 * the message is modified.
 * <p>
 * Any other problem is taken care in a simple way. No exception is caught by
 * the client, meaning that any SOAP or transmission exception will leak out to
 * the main application, but if for some reason there is no exception and the
 * response is empty then a {@code null} value will be returned.
